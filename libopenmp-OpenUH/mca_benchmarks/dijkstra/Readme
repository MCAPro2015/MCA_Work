To translate from C file to w2c.c file, use UHCC with command:
uhcc -mp -CLIST:emit_nested_pu Dijkstra.c
note: Only the file with parallel code need to translate to w2c file before compiling, e.g. Dijkstra.c

Command to run
Dij_gcc (number of nodes) (option to show result or not)
note: The number of nodes should be the nth of the number of threads
The option 1 would print the result, while option 0 would not print out
the results
To run Dijkstra with 40 nodes and show the result,
command should be: 
./Dijkstra 40 1
To run Dijkstra with 40 nodes but do not show the result,
command should be:
./Dijkstra 40 0
